# Destiny Pebble Tracker

Using the Bungie.net API and Pebble.JS, I have created a simple Pebble app to pull through character information including:

* Power Level
* Glimmer
* Grimoire Score
* Vanguard/Cruicible/Cryptarch levels and progression
* Primary and Secondary stats

Roadmap:

* Vanguard/Crucible mark totals and progression
* Improve the interface
* Optimise the JSON calls

As it took me a while to source the relevant Pebble.JS pieces to build this app, I am making it open-source. Please feel free to help update, optimise and improve.
